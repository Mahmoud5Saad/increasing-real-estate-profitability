increasing real estate management profitability through Data analysis and exploiting the chances


Elicitation

Project notes:
1.	Limited time for analysis.
2.	One of our customers is interested in working with short term rentals instead of long term.
Project scope:
(1) Calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental.
(2) Determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to short-term rentals.
(3) Calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals. 
(4) Determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.
(5) Determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties.

The business recommendation: 
Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market using some of this client’s property portfolio, or not? If so, which properties should be converted first?
